#1 Overview
 
   This program is intended to give the number of declarations
   (Decs) and procedures (Procs) used in a project.  Also to
   display some items within Procs and a variety of unused
   items.  To be most useful the exe can be placed on the
   Office toolbar or the Taskbar.  It can then analyse the
   current project provided it is saved to disk. It is
   non-intrusive  A second use is to copy/paste code from
   any other project while in the IDE.
   
   Files are loaded from a *.vbp file. Either from a
   load dialog, CSInfo.txt or dropping a vbp file
   onto the exe.
   
   Only the files with extensions:-
   .frm, .bas, .cls, .ctl, .dsr & .pag
   are looked at.  The names will appear in the left-hand
   listbox.  Selecting a file there displays the declarations
   (Decs) and procedure (Procs) names in the top-right list
   box and the code, as written, in the RTB richtextbox below.
   
   The various menu items etc can then be tried out.
   On exit the current vbp filespec is saved to CSInfo.txt
   in the app folder.
   
#2 Menu items
 
   Hopefully these are fairly self-explanatory.
   
   [Stats]       Select module or whole project giving the
                 number of Decs and Procs
   
   [List All A]  Shows Decs & Procs for the whole project.
   
   [List All B]  A selection of Proc details.  The last in
                 this menu list (List Non-Control Proc Callers)
                 shows where the various Procs are called from.
   
   [Unused A]    Unused items from all the declaration
                 sections.
   
   [Unused B]    Unused items in Procs apart from the last
                 showing unused non-control procs.
                 
#3 Squash and Strip
 
        This is done by the 4 large buttons on the left.
        For a particular file or the whole project, Squash
        removes all unecessary characters while, for
        individually selected files, is still a viable vb file.
        Strip removes the controls description and attributes
        header.  Only useful to shorten the text in the RTB.
        
#4 Find & Find Next
 
        First, selecting a Dec or Proc item in Dec & Procs
        listbox highlights the item in the RTB.
        Second, the Find button brings up a combobox in which
        a string can be entered or pasted for searching.
        
#5 RTB Options

        The text in the RTB can be changed as Font Size, Bold,
        Underline or colored.  Coloring can be stopped.
        EG 28500=lines takes ~45 sec on a 1.8 GHz PC.
        Line numbers can be toggled on/off.  Horizontal
        scrollbars switched on/off.  Selected text highlighted
        and RTB maximized on a separate window.  Note that the
        maximized RTB retains it's contents unless closed.  So
        there can be two different displays.

#6 Saving, Copying & Printing
 
        The RTB can be saved at any point, but only as a *.txt
        file.  It takes a long time before I would trust
        overwriting project files!
        Selections from the RTB can be copied to the clipboard
        in the usual way.
        All or a selection of the RTB text can also be printed.
        NB Before printing take note of number of lines -
           ~70 lines/page !!
        
#7 Limitations
 
        Assumes variables are defined

        Not done:-
        Unused Controls
        Unused Modules
        Unused Control Procedures

        Only checks vars as declared eg var$ can be used as
        var without $ then NOT checked or var As String can be
        used as var$ also NOT checked.
 
        Unused only based on > 1 occurrence of item, so gives
        guidance only!  Also some unused vars need to be kept
        eg Types for APIs.

        If there is a Private Sub & a Public Sub in a different
        module, both unused but with exactly the same name, then
        the Private Sub will be marked unused but NOT the Public
        Sub.

        Also due to the complexity allowed for writing vb files
        parsing is a bit of a nightmare and the likelyhood of
        getting it all right first time, remote!!  My experience
        with classes and user controls is limited and with dsr 
        and pag files non-existent - so items like Class
        Initialize, Dsr Initiates, some RaiseEvents which have
        partial call names, will be lumped with UNUSED 
        (Class/Dsr/REv IT).

        It's 'horses for courses' CodeScan suits me but try
        these others if you haven't already, they may be closer
        to what you want.
